# Baseball
This package fetches and parses event data for Major League Baseball games.

## Installing from pypi
```
pip3 install baseball
```
## Installing from source
```
git clone git@github.com:benjamincrom/baseball.git
cd baseball/
python3 setup.py install
```

## Fetch individual MLB game
* __get_game_from_url(__*date_str, away_code, home_code, game_number*__)__

Fetch an object which contains metadata and events for a single MLB game.
```python
import baseball
game_id, game = baseball.get_game_from_url('2017-11-1', 'HOU', 'LAD', 1)
```

## Fetch list of MLB games
* __get_game_list_from_file_range(__*start_date_str, end_date_str, input_dir*__)__

Fetch a list of game objects which each contain metadata and events for a single MLB game.
First, download and unzip the source data:
```shell
wget https://spaces-host.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/livebaseballscorecards-artifacts/baseball_files_2008-2017.zip
unzip baseball_files_2008-2017.zip -d ./baseball_files_2008-2017
```
Then import the files in Python using this library:
```python
import baseball
game_tuple_list = baseball.get_game_list_from_file_range('1-1-2017', '12-31-2017', 'baseball_files_2008-2017')
```
See [the included Jupyter notebook](baseball_stats.ipynb) for examples on how to use a game object for analysis.

### Make Move
* __scrabble.main.ScrabbleGame.place\_word(__*word, start_location, is_vertical_move*__)__

Place a word from the rack of the next player onto the board.  If the
move is legal you will be prompted as to whether or not the move was
successfully challenged.  If the move goes through through then the method will
return `True`.  If the move is illegal you will not receive a challenge prompt
and the method will return `False`.
```
>>> game.place_word(word='GATE', start_location=('h', 8), is_vertical_move=False)

Find the best move via brute-force search.  Returns the move score and move
tuple of the form *(location, word, is_vertical_move)*.
```
>>> game.get_best_move()

(27, (('l', 4), 'EGOISM', True))
```

### Exchange Tiles

one entire rack of tiles remaining.

(plays out) when the tile bag is empty.
```
>>> game.conclude_game()
Game Over! Player 1 wins with a score of 10
```
